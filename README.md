# Burp-suite-tool-stimulation

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

Burp Suite is a powerful tool for web application security testing. In this practical, I explored and simulated the following key functionalities of Burp Suite:
- **Intruder**: Automated attack simulation.
- **Repeater**: Manual crafting and testing of HTTP requests.
- **Decoder**: Encoding and decoding various data formats.
- **Proxy**: Intercepting and analyzing HTTP/HTTPS requests.

This repository includes a detailed **PDF report** of the simulations performed, the tools used, and key learnings from the practical.
